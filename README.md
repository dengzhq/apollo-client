## Features

1. Not all features are default, you can read the `[features]` section of [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/jmjoy/apollo-client/blob/master/Cargo.toml) to know all the features.

1. The `xml` and `yaml` features aren't enable by default, if you have such kind namespace, you should add `features` in `Cargo.toml`, just like:

    ```toml
    apollo-client = { version = "0.6", features = ["yaml", "xml"] }
    ```

    Or simply enable all features:

    ```toml
    apollo-client = { version = "0.6", features = ["full"] }
    ```
