RustðŸ¦€ client for [Apollo](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo).

Power by Rust `async/await`.

## Installation

With [cargo add](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) installed run:

```sh
$ cargo add -s apollo-client
```

## Features

1. Not all features are default, you can read the `[features]` section of [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/jmjoy/apollo-client/blob/master/Cargo.toml) to know all the features.

1. The `xml` and `yaml` features aren't enable by default, if you have such kind namespace, you should add `features` in `Cargo.toml`, just like:

    ```toml
    apollo-client = { version = "0.5", features = ["yaml", "xml"] }
    ```

    Or simply enable all features:

    ```toml
    apollo-client = { version = "0.5", features = ["full"] }
    ```

1. By default, using curl client `isahc` to handle http request, you can switch to `hyper` by enable the `with-hyper` feature.

    ```toml
    apollo-client = { version = "0.5", default-features = false, features = ["with-hyper"] }
    ```

    Or:

    ```toml
    apollo-client = { version = "0.5", default-features = false, features = ["full-hyper"] }
    ```

    Or specify the `Scenario`.
